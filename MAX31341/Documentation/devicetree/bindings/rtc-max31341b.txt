Dallas DS1307 and compatible RTC

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	"maxim,max31341b"
- reg: I2C bus address of the device

Optional properties:
- interrupts: rtc alarm interrupt.
- wakeup-source: Enables wake up of host system on alarm
- trickle-resistor-ohms : Selected resistor for trickle charger
	Possible values are 3000, 6000, 11000
	Should be given if trickle charger should be enabled
- trickle-diode-enable : Enables extra diode for trickle charger
	Should be given if internal trickle charger diode should be enabled
	Should not be given if internal trickle charger diode should be disabled
- backup-threshold : Changes default value of backup threshold voltage
	Possible values are 0 for 1.3V, 1 for 1.7V, 2 for 2.0V, 3 for 2.2V
	Should be given if default value (1.7V) needs to be changed
- power-management: Changes default power management mode (mode 1)
	Possible values are 
	0 for comparator mode,
	1 for power management auto and trickle charger is on,
	2 for power management manual and trickle charger is on, Vcc is active supply
	3 for power management manual and trickle charger is on, AIN is active supply,
	if AIN > Vcc

Example:
	max31341b: max31341b@69 {
		compatible = "maxim,max31341b";
		reg = <0x69>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <16 8>;
		trickle-resistor-ohms=<6000>;
		backup-threshold=<3>;
		power-management=<1>;
		trickle-diode-enable="OK";
