Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Maxim MAX34417 chip.

The MAX34417 is a specialized current and voltage monitor used to
determine power consumption of portable systems.

The device has a very wide dynamic range (20,000:1) that allows for
the accurate measurement of power in such systems. The device is configured
and monitored with a standard I2C/SMBus serial interface.
